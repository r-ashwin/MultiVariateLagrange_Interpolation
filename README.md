# MultiVariateLagrange_Interpolation

Interpolates a vector valued parametric function
 using polynomials in the Lagrange form. More
 specifically, interpolation is done using a multivariate
 polynomial of order 'n' with 'm' variables. The key
 step is the creation of of a polynomial kernel automatically,
 given m and n.
 
 # Dependencies
 permn()
 
 Generates a permutation of integers from 0-n which is used in
 the kernel building.
